<h2>Why Choose the College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S)?</h2>
<p>What's so great about a liberal arts education from UW–Madison?</p>
<p>For one thing, it makes for a college experience that is rich in discovery, exploration, personal growth, and new ideas.</p>
<p>But while your courses may be fascinating, liberating, eye-opening and mind-blowing, a liberal arts degree from UW–Madison keeps working for you long after you have graduated.</p>
<p>By pursuing a degree in the liberal arts—a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science—you are preparing for long-term satisfaction in work and in life. A liberal arts degree is a journey of self-discovery, as you explore new topics and discuss ideas with a wide range of people. You delve deeply into a broad range of subjects beyond just your major. When you graduate, you aren’t narrowly prepared for one field. You’ve developed writing, presentation, and analytical skills. You’ve been exposed to the scientific method, as well as literary analysis. A chemistry major, for example, will also graduate with knowledge of a language, history, social science, the arts, and more.</p>
<h5>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</h5>
<p>Because the more you know, the more curious you become. Curious people seek opportunities to enrich and expand their lives. Learning leads to conversation, dialogue, innovation, advancement. Employers value liberal arts majors because they are problem-solvers, out-of-the-box thinkers, and good communicators. </p>
<h5>CAN A 4-YEAR DEGREE FROM L&amp;S REALLY OPEN DOORS WITH EMPLOYERS? </h5>
<p>Yes, it can. Based on a recent L&amp;S alumni survey rigorously designed and administered by the university’s nationally renowned survey center, our graduates’ employment rates are on par with the School of Business and the College of Engineering, and out-perform the national average for university graduates. They work for an extremely wide range of fields, including technology, corporate management, education, and nonprofits.</p>
<p>L&amp;S alumni also report high job satisfaction and believe that their academic preparation gave them an advantage compared to employees from other colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Then there's our <a href="http://ls.wisc.edu/lsci" target="_blank">L&amp;S Career Initiative</a> (LSCI)—unique among large public universities. Funded by alumni and sponsored by key employers, the LSCI is designed to help each and every one of our students—not just the extra-motivated or well-connected few—define his or her path. We start where <em>y</em><em class="redactor-inline-converted">ou</em> are—and go from there. From the basics of resume-building, to connecting with alumni mentors, to landing an internship, the resources are at your fingertips.</p>
<h5>BUT WE VALUE LEARNING FOR ITS OWN SAKE, HERE. </h5>
<p>You will never regret your liberal arts degree from UW–Madison, because it gives you the opportunity to explore subjects that fascinate you, as well as prepare you for a successful career. You will connect with wonderful faculty from 125 departments, programs, centers and institutes, whose mentoring and teaching will influence your goals and direction. And you will gain an appreciation for learning that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin–Madison is one of the great universities of the world, and the <a href="http://www.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">College of Letters &amp; Science</a> is at its center. Students who earn a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree in the College of Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) complement their broad study in the liberal arts and sciences with in-depth study of one or more particular fields, or "majors." Majors range from African cultural studies to philosophy in the humanities, from astronomy to zoology in the natural sciences, and from Afro-American studies to sociology in the social sciences.</p>
<p>In addition to the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees available in L&amp;S, the college also offers a limited number of special degrees. These programs often have additional admission requirements and require completion of additional requirements in the major.</p>
<p>Finally, a wide array of certificate programs are also available for students who have special interests in such diverse topics as integrated liberal studies; international, global, and area studies; religious, ethnic, and gender studies; and more.</p>

<a name="degreesmajorscertificatestext"></a> <p>All students pursuing their undergraduate studies in the College of Letters &amp; Science <strong>must</strong> fulfill the following requirements:  </p> <ul> <li><a href="/undergraduate/#requirementsforundergraduatestudytext" target="_blank">General Education Requirements</a></li> <li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#requirementstext" target="_blank">Letters &amp; Science Requirements</a></li> <li>Major/Degree/Certificate Requirements (See below)</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Certificates <em>are not required </em>for graduation from L&amp;S.  With a few exceptions,  students are expected to complete all requirements for a certificate program prior to graduating. </strong></p> <p style="margin-left:40px">L&amp;S will award all declared and completed certificates upon graduation with the L&amp;S degree. <strong>Certificates that are not complete at the time of graduation will not be awarded.</strong> Students who have satisfied all major and degree requirements will not be delayed from graduating if they have unmet requirements in a declared certificate program.</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">Although most certificates <strong>must</strong> be completed at the same time students have completed all  of their major and degree requirements, there are a very limited number of certificates that are available to students after they graduate. Students who have completed a substantial portion (as least 12 credits) of a certificate at UW–Madison, and who may need one or two additional courses to complete the certificate, may do so immediately after completing a bachelor’s degree. This provision is not universal; it applies to a limited number of certificates only. Students seeking to complete certificates eligible under this provision should enroll in the remaining coursework as a University Special (non-degree) student. A certificate must be completed within a year of completion of the bachelor's degree. More information about L&amp;S certificates can be found at <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#policiesandregulationstext" target="_blank">certificate programs</a> under Courses and Enrollment.</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">For general information about certificates and which ones can be earned/completed as a University Special, see<a href="/nondegree/undergraduate-special-student-certificates/" target="_blank"> undergraduate/special student certificates</a>.</p> <p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>NOTE:  Major requirements are the same whether a student pursues a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree.</strong></p> <div class="visual-sitemap grid"><p><button class="view-choice view-as-list" onclick="toggleSitemap('list'); return false;"><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#uw-symbol-list" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></use></svg> View as list</button><button class="view-choice view-as-grid" onclick="toggleSitemap('grid'); return false;"><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#uw-symbol-grid" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></use></svg> View as grid</button></p><ul><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/african-cultural-studies/african-cultural-studies-ba/index.html"><h3>African Cultural Studies, B.A.</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/african-cultural-studies/african-cultural-studies-bs/index.html"><h3>African Cultural Studies, B.S.</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/institute-regional-international-studies/african-studies-certificate/index.html"><h3>African Studies, Certificate</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/afro-american-studies/afro-american-studies-ba/index.html"><h3>Afro-American Studies, B.A.</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/afro-american-studies/afro-american-studies-bs/index.html"><h3>Afro-American Studies, B.S.</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/afro-american-studies/afro-american-studies-certificate/index.html"><h3>Afro-American Studies, Certificate</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/american-indian-studies/american-indian-studies-certificate/index.html"><h3>American Indian Studies, Certificate</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/anthropology/anthropology-ba/index.html"><h3>Anthropology, B.A.</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/anthropology/anthropology-bs/index.html"><h3>Anthropology, B.S.</h3></a></li><li><a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/mathematics/applied-mathematics-engineering-physics-bs-amep/index.html"><h3>Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics, B.S.

<h2 headerid="0" name="enteringthecollegetext">Admissions</h2> <p>Any student interested in earning an undergraduate degree in the College of Letters &amp; Science will need to apply for admission through the Office of Admissions and Recruitment at UW–Madison. Information on applying to the university as a freshman, transfer, or international student is available through the <a href="https://www.admissions.wisc.edu/apply/" target="_blank">Office of Admissions and Recruitment</a>.</p> <p>Prospective students with questions about study in the College of Letters &amp; Science may contact <a href="http://advising.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">L&amp;S Academic Advising Services</a> at 608-262-5858 or <a href="https://ccas.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Cross-College Advising Service</a> at 608-265-5460. Students should also feel free to contact the <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#degreesmajorscertificatestext" target="_blank">major department</a> directly if they have specific questions about a particular major.</p> <h2 headerid="1" name="enteringthecollegetext">Transfer Students </h2> <p>Transfer students interested in earning an undergraduate degree in the College of Letters &amp; Science will need to apply for admission through the Office of Admissions and Recruitment at UW–Madison. Transfer students must complete all Letters &amp; Science degree requirements. Once admitted, transfer students should obtain a copy of their <a href="https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars-student/" target="_blank">DARS</a> report which will explain how their transfer credits will apply toward L&amp;S requirements. Students can request and review their DARS in the Student Center via <a href="https://my.wisc.edu" target="_blank">My UW</a>. Students can also request DARS for programs, majors, or certificates that they have not declared but are interested in declaring. These reports are called "what-if" reports.  (Please note that some programs may not be available in DARS. For information about requirements in a program not available in DARS, contact the advisor for the particular program.)</p> <p><strong>Please note that the DARS audit serves as the <em>document of record</em> (DOR) for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science.   The DOR is used to certify completion of degree requirements, and it is retained according to university record retention and archival polices.</strong></p> <p>Students can transfer only a limited number of credits from non-degree-granting accredited institutions and correspondence courses. See <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#policiesandregulationstext" target="_blank">non-degree-granting accredited institutions' transfer credit limitation</a> in the <em>Guide</em> under <em><strong>Credits</strong></em>.</p> <p>Transfer students who have more than 30 degree credits <em><strong>are ineligible</strong></em> to earn retroactive credits in a foreign language on the UW–Madison campus. See <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#policiesandregulationstext" target="_blank">credit by course examination/retroactive credits</a> in the <em>Guide</em> under <em><strong>Credits</strong></em>.</p> <p>Advisors for freshman and sophomore students are in the L&amp;S Academic Advising Services (608-262-5858) in 101 Ingraham Hall and the Cross-College Advising Service (608-265-5460) in 10 Ingraham Hall. Junior and senior transfer students should meet with an advisor in the department in which they intend to major.  <strong>All L&amp;S undergraduate students are expected to declare a major by the time they have 86 degree credits</strong>.</p> <p>Transfer students should note that the L&amp;S degree requirements have changed as of summer 2007. Those students who matriculated before May 21, 2007 are eligible to complete the degree requirements in force at the time they began their college-level studies. (See previous catalogs under <a href="/archive/" target="_blank">Archive</a> for more information.)</p> <p>Because some requirements in force before this edition of the <em>Guide</em> differ substantially from the requirements articulated here, transfer students are strongly encouraged to refer to the undergraduate catalog or <em>Guide</em> in force at the time of their first matriculation to college. (See <a href="/archive/" target="_blank">past catalogs</a> to review the requirements that apply.) For some students, it may be to their benefit to consider transferring to the new degree requirements; they may consult with their academic advisor if they wish to consider this option.</p> <h2 headerid="2" name="enteringthecollegetext">On-Campus Transfer</h2> <p>Continuing UW–Madison students must have a minimum 2.000 cumulative grade point average <em><strong>and</strong></em> a UW–Madison grade point average of at least 2.000 in their most recent semester of work in order to transfer into the College of Letters &amp; Science. First-semester and new transfer students without a UW–Madison grade point average may transfer into Letters &amp; Science provided they meet university admission requirements (three units of math and two units of a single foreign language). Students admitted to the university with admission deficiencies must remove those deficiencies before they are eligible to transfer into L&amp;S. <strong>For more information about transferring into L&amp;S, call 608-262-5858 or refer to <a href="https://advising.ls.wisc.edu/transfer/" target="_blank">request to transfer into L&amp;S</a></strong>.</p> <p>Students transferring into one of the general courses from a special course (AMEP, Music), or from another college/school of the university to the College of Letters &amp; Science will receive no more than 18 credits per semester toward graduation for work already completed, unless a 3.000 grade point average was earned the previous semester or the semester the overload was carried. Then a maximum of 20 credits from that term may be transferred. These transferring students will receive credit for studies in another college/school, but will be subject to the conditions of the Liberal Arts and Science Credits requirement. (See <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#requirementstext" target="_blank">Liberal Arts and Science Credits</a>.)</p> <h2 headerid="3" name="enteringthecollegetext">University Special Students</h2> <p>If you are not currently enrolled in a UW–Madison degree program but wish to take courses within the College of Letters &amp; Science at UW–Madison for credit as a non degree-seeking candidate or as an auditor, it may be best to consider becoming a <a href="https://acsss.wisc.edu/special-student-types/" target="_blank">special student</a>.   Information about becoming a non degree-seeking student at UW–Madison can be found at <a href="https://acsss.wisc.edu/apply/" target="_blank">Adult Career and Special Student Services</a>.  </p>

If an L&amp;S undergraduate student believes a clerical error has been made in the awarding of the final grade for a course, the student should first meet with the instructor of the course to determine whether such an error has occurred. Requests for a change of grade must be signed by both the instructor of the course and the chair of the department. Students who believe they have been unfairly graded in a course should follow the appeal procedure established by the department in which the course grade was given.</p> <p style="margin-left:80px">The appeal procedure typically requires the student to first meet with the instructor of the course to discuss the issue, followed by a meeting with the department chair or department committee. If the issue is still unresolved after the department appeal procedure is completed, the student's last recourse would be to appeal to one of the Associate Deans in the College of Letters &amp; Science based on the discipline of the course in question. Appeals of final grades must be initiated within the semester immediately following the term in which the course is taken.

If an instructor grants an extended incomplete (EI), a grade change will need to be filed by the instructor, approved by the chairperson of the department, and forwarded to L&amp;S Undergraduate Academic Deans' Services in 110 Ingraham Hall.  In such cases the grade of I is replaced with the grade of extended incomplete (EI).</p> <p style="margin-left:80px"><strong>NOTE:  Extended Incompletes (EI) must be removed and replaced with the final grade by the last day of classes prior to the start of final exams or they will lapse into Failures</strong>.  The last day of classes is defined as the last day of  instruction for a given term prior to the start of study day and final exams.</p> <p style="margin-left:80px">Incompletes incurred in the last semester in residence at UW–Madison may not be removed after five years of absence from the University without special advance permission from L&amp;S Undergraduate Academic Deans' Services.

Knowledge of a foreign language is important for an appreciation of the culture of the people using that language, and it also helps students to understand the structure and complexities of their own native language. Students with sufficient preparation may be able to use the foreign language for study in their chosen discipline.</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">To be admitted to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, students must have completed the second-year level of a single foreign language (or American Sign Language) in high school.

Algebra and geometry provide the minimum of mathematics skills that an educated person needs in today's world, and competence in these areas is required for admission to the university.

Every student in the College of Letters &amp; Science experiences significant exposure to three principal fields of knowledge: the arts and humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. These broad fields of knowledge are not the same as the areas of depth that we call "majors." In fact, any particular major—or even a particular course within a major—might well involve more than one of these fields of knowledge. (For example, imagine a seminar on "people and the environment" that combines historical background, research on social patterns of energy use, and scientific understandings of climate.) Working together, each of these three fields of knowledge represents a particular "way of knowing" about the world around us.</div> <h4 style="margin-left:40px">Arts and Humanities</h4> <div style="margin-left:40px">Courses in the <strong>arts and humanities</strong> involve knowing the world through the production and analysis of artistic, literary, and scholarly work. Some courses examine the fine and performing arts, or literature, presenting students with opportunities to interpret and think critically about these creative expressions of the human condition. Other courses help students to understand and compare religious and philosophical conceptions of humankind. Still other courses take on historical subjects, focusing on moments of change and periods of continuity for the peoples and regions of the world. These courses all encourage students to analyze the range of creative and cultural artifacts, expressions, and ideas of human existence—history, literature, art, culture, folklore—and to use that information to better understand humanity and to cultivate civic and social responsibility.</div> <h4 style="margin-left:40px">Social Sciences</h4> <div style="margin-left:40px">Courses in the <strong>social sciences</strong> involve knowing the world through the systematic study of human society, interactions, and institutions. The social sciences explore these issues from a wide range of perspectives and research techniques, both quantitative and qualitative. Through these courses students learn how to formulate research questions and determine what techniques are best used to answer those questions—for example, exploring ideas and developing theories, conducting surveys and building models, or observing and participating in social life itself. Developing such analytical skills assists students as they approach complex problems and seek to solve them in both the workplace and the community.</div> <h4 style="margin-left:40px">Natural Sciences</h4> <div style="margin-left:40px">Courses in the <strong>natural sciences</strong> involve knowing the world through scientific inquiry—assembling objective information that can be used to explain observed natural phenomena in a way that is thorough and verifiable. The natural sciences are often divided into the <strong>physical sciences</strong> (dealing with matter and energy, or the study of the earth, atmosphere, and oceans) and the <strong>biological sciences</strong> (dealing with life and living systems, like plants, animals, and environments). These courses often contain laboratory components that allow students to gain firsthand experience in scientific research methods. By completing this requirement, science and non-science majors alike will gain an appreciation for science as a way of systematically looking at the natural world, understanding how this process can be used to inform decision-making in a wide range of political, economic, and social contexts.</div> <div style="margin-left:40px"> </div> <div style="margin-left:40px">Together, these broad "ways of knowing" give students a complementary set of tools for seeing, imagining, and asking questions about the world—tools that enhance creative problem solving no matter what the field. And, because twenty-first-century knowledge is not neatly compartmentalized, it is worth noting that these areas of study intersect and overlap; courses in some areas draw upon strategies used in the others. Experiences in "breadth" courses can be life-changing: we frequently hear that a course taken to fulfill a breadth requirement introduced someone to a subject that became a new major, a new way of looking at a current major, or a lifelong interest. For more information, visit the <a href="https://kb.wisc.edu/ls/page.php?id=27031" target="_blank">KnowledgeBase help document</a>.</div> <div style="margin-left:40px"> </div> <p style="margin-left:40px">A liberal education involves not only the nature and kinds of knowledge but also the purpose for which knowledge should be used. These considerations are embodied in the breadth or distribution requirement and call for knowledge in several fields of learning. The purpose of this breadth requirement is to ensure that a degree candidate will obtain an understanding of approaches in the humanities, social sciences, biological sciences, and physical sciences adequate for use both as a citizen and as a specialist.</p> <h4 style="margin-left:40px">Breadth Requirements</h4> <p style="margin-left:40px">The L&amp;S breadth requirement is met with 36 credits in the three broad areas of knowledge: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Please note that if a course can satisfy more than one breadth designation (such as a “Z” course, which can meet EITHER Humanities OR Social Science), students may select the course designation in which they want the course to count for the purpose of fulfilling a particular breadth requirement. However, this course may be counted only once and in only one area. <strong>Credits cannot be split between two distinct breadth areas</strong>.</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">Courses that carry L&amp;S breadth credit are expected to broaden significantly a student's understanding of the world and a general disciplinary approach to problems studied, questions asked, modes of inquiry undertaken to answer those questions, analysis of research findings, communication about results, and implications for further study and/or action. Many courses in L&amp;S carry a breadth designation; however, some types of courses may not convey breadth.  </p> <h4 class="toggle" style="margin-left:80px">B.A. Degree</h4> <p style="margin-left:80px"><strong>Humanities:</strong> Students are required to complete <em><strong>12 credits</strong></em> in the humanities, 6 of which <em><strong>must</strong></em> be in literature.  Look in the <a href="/courses/" target="_blank">courses</a> section of the Guide under Course Designation for course qualifications. </p> <p style="margin-left:80px"><strong>Social Sciences:</strong> Students are required to complete <em><strong>12 credits</strong></em> in social sciences.  Look in the <a href="/courses/" target="_blank">courses</a> section of the Guide under Course Designation for course qualifications.</p> <p style="margin-left:80px"><strong>Natural Sciences:</strong> Students are required to complete <em><strong>12 credits</strong></em> in natural sciences.  Students <em><strong>must</strong></em> take at least one <em><strong>3+ credit</strong></em> course in <strong>physical science</strong> <strong>AND</strong> one <strong><em>3+ credit</em> </strong>course in <strong>biological science</strong>.  The additional six (6) credits can be any combination of natural, biological or physical science credits to bring the total to <strong>twelve (12)</strong> credits.   Look in the <a href="/courses/" target="_blank">courses</a> section of the Guide under Course Designation for course qualifications.</p> <h4 class="toggle" style="margin-left:80px">B.S.

This intensive understanding of one topic helps students to appreciate the potential depth of the others. A student's work in the major reflects a continuing progression of skills, knowledge, and values, where advanced learning opportunities in upper-level coursework grow from and expand upon earlier experiences, helping students build additional depth in writing, speaking, information literacy, and critical thinking skills from the perspective of a particular discipline. In senior capstone or independent research projects, students are frequently asked to synthesize what they have learned and apply it in a variety of new situations. By the conclusion of their studies, students in the major are better able to understand themselves and their society, to develop their intellectual powers outside of a University setting, and to make productive contributions to the world around them.  (See list of <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#degreesmajorscertificatestext" target="_blank">L&amp;S majors</a>.)</p> <h3 class="toggle">MAJOR STUDY</h3> <p style="margin-left:40px">Every candidate for an L&amp;S baccalaureate degree <strong>must</strong> satisfy a depth requirement encompassing a specified and approved major field of study.

The purpose of this requirement is to encourage students to undertake advanced work to the greatest possible extent and to ensure that they achieve greater sophistication and a deeper mastery of subject matter as they advance through the baccalaureate curriculum.</p> <h3 class="toggle">RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT IN THE MAJOR</h3> <p style="margin-left:40px">All L&amp;S undergraduate students must complete 15 degree credits of upper-level work in their major and in residence. Upper-level courses are classes determined by the major program/department to be in-depth within the context of that particular major.  In addition, students must complete 15 credits in the major/subject “on campus.” These are courses taken in residence where the instructional content is provided by a UW-Madison instructor. This excludes instruction by affiliated institutions, such as those offering UW-Madison students credit abroad.  </p> <h3 class="toggle">RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT in the Degree</h3> <p style="margin-left:40px">All L&amp;S students must earn a minimum of 30 degree credits in residence at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A course is considered in residence if the student enrolls for credit through UW-Madison. This would include any course that is offered:</p> <ul style="margin-left:40px"> <li>By UW-Madison, in any instructional mode (in-person, online, or hybrid)</li> <li>Through a UW-Madison administered program, either domestically or internationally (i.e., Study Abroad through International Academic Programs)</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left:40px">A course is not in residence when credit is earned via:</p> <ul style="margin-left:40px"> <li>A course transferred from another institution, including other UW System schools or UW Extension;</li> <li>A course taken abroad through another institition;</li> <li>Credit awarded according to scores earned on AP (Advanced Placement), IB (International Baccalaureate), or other approved exams;</li> <li>Retroactive foreign language credit.</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left:40px">UW-Extension and other campuses in the University of Wisconsin System are different institutions and credit earned at any of these campuses is considered transfer credit and not in residence.</p> <p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Senior Residence Rule.  </strong>The 30 minimum credits a student must earn in residence should be completed in the senior year (<em><strong>after a student has completed 86 degree credits</strong></em>).  This requirement intends to ensure that the student's depth of study -- which should occur in more advanced-level courses, within the major, with faculty instruction, and in areas of research -- are uniquely <em>UW-Madison</em> experiences.  These credits do not have to be contiguous for the requirement to be met.  Because the requirement begins with the 87th credits, students have the flexibility to take four (4) credits out of residence in the senior year without needing to obtain special permission.  Exceptions to the senior residence requirement may be granted in cases where a student is in <a href="http://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/#policiesandregulationstext" target="_blank">good academic standing</a> and has a specific need to take fewer than 30 credits in their senior year.  Consult an <a href="https://saa.ls.wisc.edu/offices/academic-deans-services/" target="_blank">L&amp;S academic dean</a> for more information. </p> <h3 class="toggle">QUALITY OF WORK REQUIREMENTS</h3> <p style="margin-left:40px">A total of 120 degree credits is required for graduation, with a <strong>minimum</strong> 2.000 grade point average on all courses taken in residence, whether or not each course is passed.</p> <p style="margin-left:40px">The quality of work requirements establish a minimum grade point average in four specific areas that <strong>must be met</strong> to receive a Letters &amp; Science degree. In order to satisfy these requirements, the student must earn a minimum 2.000 grade point average on all courses carried at UW–Madison, whether passed or not, in these areas:</p> <ol style="margin-left:120px"> <li>All courses carried for a grade at UW–Madison (cumulative grade point average, as reported by the Registrar).</li> <li>​All courses designated Intermediate (I) or Advanced (A);</li> <li>All courses in the major (or majors) or program;</li> <li>All upper-level courses in the major or program, as designated by the major department or program, for the 15-credit residence requirement;</li> <li>All courses carried for a grade at UW–Madison (cumulative grade point average, as reported by the Registrar). Courses carried on a refresher basis (see <a href="https://kb.wisc.edu/ls/page.php?id=21934" target="_blank">Is it possible to retake a course that I have already passed or received degree credit</a>) are excluded from the grade point average as determined for categories 2, 3, and 4 above. Repeating a failed course <strong>will not</strong> remove the failure from the student's record or from GPA calculations. This summary of college grade point requirements does not include those for admission to certain majors and special courses within the college or to other colleges and schools within the university, or to honors courses.</li> </ol> <h3 class="toggle">Foundations: Tools for Learning</h3> <p>For all UW–Madison undergraduates, these learning experiences begin with students satisfying the university's General Education Requirements—usually by taking courses taught within the College of Letters &amp; Science. These common foundations cover key topics which are necessary for any undergraduate major and any prospective career: oral and written communication; mathematical and logical reasoning; and the diversity of cultures within global society.</p> <p>In addition to these university-wide requirements, all L&amp;S students must attain knowledge of a foreign language, in work that combines training in both communication and culture, so students may better understand and participate in the global community of the twenty-first century. Together, these "tools for learning" may be acquired through many different courses taught by many different departments. The key is that they are never taught in isolation, but always considered together with broad exposure to various "ways of knowing" from the arts and humanities, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. (For more on the General Education Requirements, see <a href="/undergraduate/#requirementsforundergraduatestudytext" target="_blank">Requirements for Undergraduate Study</a><a href="http://www.ls.wisc.edu/gened/" title="General Education Requirements">;</a> for more on the L&amp;S requirements, see <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#requirementstext" target="_blank">Letters &amp; Science Degrees</a>.)</p> <h3 class="toggle"><a name="degrees"></a>Letters &amp; Science Degrees</h3> <p>The College of Letters &amp; Science offers two basic degrees for students in the General Course and five other degrees for students in special programs. Students in the General Course, regardless of major, may earn either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree. The special degrees are: Bachelor of Science–Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics (AMEP); Bachelor of Arts–Journalism or Bachelor of Science–Journalism; Bachelor of Landscape Architecture; Bachelor of Music; and Bachelor of Social Work. (For details, see sections for <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/mathematics/applied-mathematics-engineering-physics-bs-amep/" target="_blank">AMEP</a>, <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/journalism-mass-communication/" target="_blank">Journalism</a>, <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/planning-landscape-architecture/landscape-architecture-bla/index.html" target="_blank">Landscape Architecture</a>,  <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/music/" target="_blank">Music</a>, and <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/social-work/" target="_blank">Social Work</a> in the L&amp;S section of this Guide.) <strong><em>Students who have multiple majors in L&amp;S earn only one undergraduate degree.</em></strong> </p> <p>Honors degrees may be earned in all of the above (except for Landscape Architecture) upon completion of the L&amp;S Honors Program.

<h2 headerid="0" name="resourcestext">Advising in Letters &amp; Science</h2>
<p>Academic advising is an essential component of undergraduate education, and the college's commitment to providing quality advising for undergraduates is reflected in the many advising programs it offers. Students who have not yet declared a major are assigned an advisor in L&amp;S Academic Advising Services Services or the Cross-College Advising Service (see below). Students who have declared a major are assigned an advisor in their department or program.</p>
<p>All of the advising programs share the goal of assisting students in making responsible, informed decisions as they develop educational plans compatible with their potential, their interests, and their career and life ambitions. Advisors provide much more than information about course selection and academic programs; they encourage students to ask questions about the nature and direction of their learning, and they work with students to find meaningful answers to those questions. Advising involves a process in which students learn to think critically about the variety of options available to them and develop decision-making skills that will enable them to choose wisely. As adults, students themselves, however, must assume primary responsibility for choosing their academic program and making progress toward their degree.</p>
<h3>Academic Advising Services (AAS)</h3>
<p>Letters &amp; Science Academic Advising Services provides advising to pre-declared Letters &amp; Science (L&amp;S) undergraduate students who intend to complete a specific L&amp;S degree and major.</p>
<p>We assist and support students in exploring their educational goals, learning about academic requirements, navigating the university structure, and progressing toward degree completion.</p>

<h3>Major Advising</h3>
<p>Students who are eligible to declare their major should do so as soon as possible. All L&amp;S undergraduate students are expected to declare their major(s) by the time they have earned 86 degree credits. All declared students will be advised by the advisor connected with their particular major/program. For more information about advising in the major, refer to the advising and careers tab for each major/special degree program under the L&amp;S <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#degreesmajorscertificatestext" target="_blank">Degrees/Majors/Certificates</a> section of the Guide.</p>
<h3>Other Academic Resources</h3>
<h3 style="margin-left:80px">L&amp;S Undergraduate Academic Deans' Services</h3>
<p style="margin-left:80px">Academic deans provide up-to-date information on college policies, procedures, and deadlines; campus resources; and degree requirements. Academic deans also offer limited academic advising and make decisions regarding exceptions to college policy. They work closely with advising staff in L&amp;S Academic Advising Services, department advisors, and other student service personnel on the UW–Madison campus. In an institution as diverse as the University of Wisconsin–Madison, students have a wide range of values, interests, and skills. Moreover, as they progress through an academic program, their questions and concerns often change. Therefore, students are encouraged to seek the help of several different types of academic advisors during their years on campus. The university provides a system of staff and faculty advisors to address these ongoing and changing concerns.  </p>

<h2 headerid="1" name="resourcestext">Advising in the Major</h2>
<p>Juniors, seniors, and any other students who are preparing for, or have declared, a major or are contemplating a major in the College of Letters &amp; Science, are encouraged to meet with an advisor in that major department. Each department has a faculty or staff member who serves as a department advisor. This person knows about prerequisites to courses, program planning for students majoring in the department, major requirements, and in some cases, general career information related to the field. A department advisor can help students make satisfactory progress toward completing requirements in the major, and can suggest courses that address students' interests and help them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Juniors and seniors are encouraged to seek advice from these department advisors as soon as possible. <strong>Please note that the assignment of a departmental advisor and declaring a major in a particular department(s) are not automatic. Students must go to the department office to declare their major and to be assigned a departmental advisor for the major.</strong> Students are also advised to meet with departmental advisors early in their academic career since some majors require students to fulfill prerequisite classes and earn a minimum GPA in the designated coursework before they are eligible to declare the specific major. It is very important that students contact the major department(s) as early as possible so they aware of any prerequisites.</p>
<p>Transfer students often come to the campus knowing their intended major. These students may go directly to the department advisors for any help they need in pursuing/declaring the major.</p>
<p>Students classified in any of the special degree programs (Applied Mathematics, Engineering and Physics, Journalism, Landscape Architecture, Music, Social Work) may refer to the specific special degree under <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#degreesmajorscertificatestext" target="_blank">Degree/Majors/Certificate</a> tab within this Guide for names of professors associated with the various programs, then consult with the appropriate advisor.</p>
<p>Students pursuing Honors in the Major (HM) are encouraged to work closely with the honors coordinator in their major department regarding course and research opportunities within the department or field of interest. Special departmental advisors are available to help any students, primarily sophomores, juniors, and seniors, who have decided on their major. These advisors are located in department offices throughout the campus. Office hours vary among departments. Consult a staff telephone directory for a list of department offices and locations, or see the department descriptions in this catalog.</p>
<h2 headerid="2" name="resourcestext">International Internship Program (IIP)</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://internships.international.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">International Internship Program (IIP)</a> at UW–Madison is a resource for undergraduate students from all disciplines seeking to gain hands-on international experience. IIP’s mission is to identify, cultivate and promote high-quality internships that advance the professional training of UW–Madison undergraduate students; foster global competency; and reinforce academic learning through practical application.</p>
<p>IIP cultivates internship opportunities around the world specifically for Badgers. IIP also identifies and promotes existing international internship and research opportunities offered by other campus offices or international organizations. Both types of opportunities can be found via the IIP database and other search resources are also listed on the website. IIP offers advising for any undergraduates who are exploring internships abroad whether they are just getting started, applying to an IIP-cultivated position, or finding their own. IIP can help with the many questions that come up related to international internships including visas, agreements, academic credit, and scholarships.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://internships.international.wisc.edu/students/wip/" target="_blank">Worldwide Internship Program (WIP)</a>, a partnership with International Academic Programs (IAP), is a program for students interning outside their home countries to earn academic credit through an online course via which they engage with other UW–Madison students interning around the world. WIP offers students interning abroad structure through academic reflection, insurance and emergency support and may help with eligibility for visas or scholarships. IIP works with students doing internships for credit or not and offers advising, pre-departure and re-entry programming for any student interning abroad. For information about scholarships and other funding, see IIP's need-based <a href="https://wisc.academicworks.com/?orgId=710&amp;scholId=6121" target="_blank">WIP grants</a> and <a href="https://internships.international.wisc.edu/students/funding/" target="_blank">IIP Funding</a>. </p>
<p>An international internship is often located outside the United States, but IIP also promotes internship opportunities to apply international skills and interests domestically. There are many variables in international internships (compensation, duration, location, fees, credit and more) that IIP can help navigate. </p>

<h2 headerid="6" name="resourcestext">Study Abroad</h2>
<p>About 25% of undergraduates make study abroad an integral part of their UW–Madison experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyabroad.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">International Academic Programs (IAP)</a> at UW–Madison offers over 200 study abroad options in about 60 countries on 6 continents. In addition to taking the opportunity to learn new languages, understand new cultures and see the world, UW–Madison students study abroad to complement their on-campus academic goals, strengthen their professional potential and enrich their personal lives.</p>
<p>Students of all academic levels and majors study abroad. While many programs include language training—from the basics to full language immersion—most IAP programs have no language requirement and include courses taught in English.</p>
<p>All courses taken abroad through IAP count as “in-residence” credit, just like taking courses on campus at UW–Madison, so students advance toward their degrees while abroad. And study abroad isn’t limited to classroom experience. Many students also complete internships, do research, fieldwork and service learning.</p>
<p>In addition to resources on health, safety, academic planning and other aspects, UW–Madison students receive the information and guidance they need to plan a study abroad experiences that fits their budgets. Many study abroad programs cost about the same or less than studying on campus, and student financial aid can be applied in most cases. </p>
<p>While IAP offers programs to students of all majors, including to students in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences in collaboration with the CALS International Programs office, the College of Engineering and the School of Business also offer programs tailored specifically to the needs of their students. All of these program options are listed at <a href="https://studyabroad.wisc.edu/programs/" target="_blank">Study Abroad</a>.</p>

<h2 headerid="0" name="honorstext">L&amp;S Honors Program</h2>
<p>The College of Letters &amp; Science Honors Program seeks to provide students with a small, liberal arts college experience within this large university. The Honors Program is home to more than 1,200 motivated, curious and high-achieving students, all pursuing one of three degree tracks: Honors in the Liberal Arts, Honors in the Major, or Comprehensive Honors—the highest undergraduate degree awarded by the college. In addition to an enhanced curriculum that offers small, faculty-led courses, the program also offers academic advising services; grants, scholarships, and awards; and many professional development and co-curricular opportunities. Events, term-specific deadlines, course descriptions for the upcoming semester and much more can be found on the <a href="http://honors.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">L&amp;S Honors Program website</a>. We welcome inquiries via phone at 608-262-2984. The L&amp;S Honors Program is located in the historic Washburn Observatory at 1401 Observatory Drive in Madison, WI 53706.</p> <h2 headerid="1" name="honorstext">How to Get In</h2> <p>Students may apply to enter the L&amp;S Honors Program in any semester of their undergraduate careers. Any UW–Madison Honors credits earned before admission to the Honors Program may be applied toward Honors degree requirements. Eligibility criteria and admissions procedures differ for the different Honors degrees.</p> <h3>Admission to Honors In the Liberal Arts (HLA)</h3> <p>To become a candidate for the Honors in the Liberal Arts degree, a student must apply directly to the L&amp;S Honors Program. Students may apply at any point in their undergraduate careers provided they meet the eligibility requirements described below.</p> <p>All students admitted to the university and to the College of Letters &amp; Science are invited to apply to be considered for admission to the Honors Program to pursue the Honors in the Liberal Arts degree. Interested students can apply via an online application form. L&amp;S admitted students receive an invitation message by email that contains the URL to the online application. Admission to the program is competitive, and space is limited.</p> <p>Continuing and transfer students with a cumulative grade point average of 3.300 or above who are currently enrolled at UW–Madison or who are transferring to UW–Madison from another college or university may apply to the L&amp;S Honors Program at any time. Applications are available from the <a href="http://honors.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Honors Program website</a> and admission decisions are usually made within three weeks of submission of the completed application and supporting materials. While continuing or transfer students having 60 or more credits at the time of application to the Honors Program are eligible to participate in the Honors in the Liberal Arts (HLA) degree track, they are encouraged to consider Honors in the Major (HM) as an option (see below), since they may find it difficult to complete the HLA degree requirements if beginning that program in the junior or senior year.</p> <h3>Admission to Honors in the Major (HM)</h3> <p>Students interested in pursuing an Honors in the Major degree are encouraged to consult the <a href="/undergraduate/letters-science/#degreesmajorscertificatestext">department listings</a> in this Guide and speak with the department's academic advisors, who will be able to explain admissions procedures and requirements for the degree. After officially declaring the major and receiving authorization from the department to declare Honors in the Major, students must submit a completed Honors in the Major Declaration Form to the Honors Program office. These forms may be obtained from either the departmental advisor or the Honors Program office.</p> <h2 headerid="2" name="honorstext">Requirements</h2> <p>Honors may be earned in any L&amp;S undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Arts; Bachelor of Science; Bachelor of Science–Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics; Bachelor of Arts–Journalism or Bachelor of Science–Journalism; Bachelor of Music; and Bachelor of Social Work). For students who complete the requirements, Honors will appear on diplomas and transcripts (for example, B.A. with Honors in the Liberal Arts or B.S. with Honors in the Major).</p> <h3>Honors in the Liberal Arts (HLA)</h3> <p>Honors in the Liberal Arts is often the primary focus for most first- and second-year Honors students. It requires students earn Honors credits in a breadth of disciplines and is meant to enrich and enhance a student's academic experience outside of the major. Students who complete this curriculum develop strong skills in communication, critical thinking and complex problem solving, which will serve them well regardless of career path. The specific requirements for the HLA degree are:</p> <ol> <li>completion of the L&amp;S general degree requirements;</li> <li>a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.300;</li> <li>completion of at least 24 credits in Honors courses with grades of B or better;</li> <li>of the 24 Honors credits, at least 6 must be in the humanities, 6 in the social sciences, and 6 in the natural sciences; and</li> <li>of the 24 Honors credits, at least 15 must be "Automatic Honors" credits—that is, in courses that carry the "Honors Only" or "Accelerated Honors" designations in the <a href="http://public.my.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Course Guide</a>.</li> </ol> <h3>Honors in the Major (HM)</h3> <p>After formally declaring a major in the College of Letters &amp; Science, students may opt to pursue Honors in that Major. Honors in the Major requirements can be completed independently from Honors in the Liberal Arts; they may also be completed in conjunction with Honors in the Liberal Arts (which would result in a Comprehensive Honors degree). Each academic department and program in the college, with approval of the Faculty Honors Committee, establishes its own requirements for the Honors in the Major degree. Honors in the Major is intended for students who are interested in original research and who wish to graduate with the best possible undergraduate training in the discipline. Honors in the Major is especially appropriate for students who are considering graduate work, or who want a particularly rigorous training in research, reasoning, and writing skills useful to a wide range of career choices.</p> <p>Although many of the specific requirements for HM vary by department, all students pursuing Honors in the Major must:</p> <ol> <li>complete the L&amp;S general degree requirements;</li> <li>complete the regular major requirements;</li> <li>obtain an overall cumulative grade point average of at least 3.300;</li> <li>earn a grade of B or better in all courses counting towards Honors in the Major requirements; and</li> <li>successfully complete a capstone experience during their senior year, typically a Senior Honors Thesis (see below for more information).</li> </ol> <p>In addition to these collegewide requirements, Honors in the Major students may be required to complete additional upper-level, Honors coursework; participate in department research colloquia; and meet a minimum grade point average in all classes in the major (typically between 3.300 and 3.500).</p> <p>As mentioned above, most departments require a Senior Honors Thesis as the culmination of their Honors in the Major curriculum. In departments for which a research thesis is not the most appropriate capstone, an alternative such as a performance, a professional practicum, or a major piece of creative writing may be required instead. The two-semester Honors thesis or capstone project is often the most challenging part of the Honors in the Major experience, and for most students it also proves to be the most rewarding. The Senior Honors Thesis is a two-semester (or summer and semester) effort; students first enroll in Senior Honors Thesis 681, followed the next term by Senior Honors Thesis 682 (some departments may use different numeric designations for Senior Honors Thesis options). These two courses may not be taken concurrently. The final grade for the entire thesis is assigned after 682 has been completed.</p> <p>Students who intend to complete Honors in the Major and write a Senior Honors Thesis should consult with department advisors as early as possible. They are also strongly encouraged to begin working with a faculty advisor no later than the beginning of the junior year in order to formulate a research topic, which will enhance the student's potential for success in research grant funding cycles for their senior year. Some departments offer special courses designed to facilitate the organization, planning, and execution of Honors thesis projects. Other departments encourage (and some require) students to take a directed study or tutorial course with the thesis advisor sometime during the junior year. Students who receive funding from the L&amp;S Honors Program for their thesis research should submit an unbound copy of their thesis to the Honors Program Office.</p> <p>Students pursuing Honors in the Major in two majors may apply for Dual Thesis Authorization, which will allow them to write one interdisciplinary thesis to satisfy both major capstone requirements. Please see the Honors Program Associate Director for Academic Services to learn more about the application process prior to enrolling in the 681 course.</p> <p>Prior authorization is needed when students intend to complete either 681 or 682 while away from UW–Madison. Consult with the Associate Director for Academic Services if this is your intention.</p> <h3>Comprehensive Honors</h3> <p>Students who complete the requirements for both Honors in the Liberal Arts and Honors in the Major in at least one department or program earn Comprehensive Honors, the highest undergraduate degree awarded by the College.</p> <h2 headerid="3" name="honorstext">How to Earn Honors Credit</h2> <p>There are three unique Honors course designations, each described here:</p> <ul> <li>"Honors Only" courses are reserved for Honors candidates. They are generally small classes, led by a faculty member and designed for substantive engagement, or discussion sections or labs reserved for Honors students in larger non-Honors lecture courses. The enrollment system will automatically assign Honors credit to all enrolled students. These "Honors Only" courses are sometimes denoted with the symbol "H".</li> <li>"Accelerated Honors" are open to all students. Honors credit is awarded in recognition of the rigor and pace of the course. These Honors courses are often conducted at a faster pace than the non-Honors course counterparts or are upper-level capstone courses in a major that require significant engagement with the course material. As with "Honors Only" designated courses, the enrollment system will automatically assign Honors credit to all enrolled students. These "Accelerated Honors" courses are sometimes denoted with the symbol "!".</li> <li>"Honors Optional" designates courses for which Honors is available through an optional Honors component of the course curriculum. These courses are open to all students for enrollment. Opting into the Honors component of the course is done through the enrollment process. Students enrolled in an "Honors Optional" course are advised to consult with the instructor during the first weeks of the term to determine the Honors curriculum if it is not outlined on the syllabus. Instructors either have designated Honors curricula or students may be encouraged to develop a project idea of their own. These "Honors Optional" courses are sometimes denoted with the symbol "%".</li> </ul> <p>When the Schedule of Classes is published for the upcoming term, students can use the Enroll App to identify which courses are being offered for Honors and with which designation. A course being offered for Honors in a past term in no way guarantees that it will be offered for Honors in a future term.</p> <p>Honors candidates may also earn Honors credit through the following methods:</p> <ul> <li>Designing and successfully completing an additional Honors project for a course not carrying any of the Honors designations above in the given term. This option requires consent of the instructor and approval of the L&amp;S Honors Program. To request permission from the Honors Program, students must submit a completed Green Sheet Agreement form and all supporting documentation to the Honors Program office no later than the sixth week of a regular semester, or the fourth week of an eight-week summer term. Green Sheets are available on the <a href="http://honors.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Honors Program website</a>. Supporting documentation includes a formal proposal outlining the additional Honors project in up to 500 words, and a completed Course Change Request Form. Additional information is available from Honors advisors and on the Honors Program website.</li> <li>Students who study abroad on a non-Honors study abroad program may petition to have one course (up to four credits) per semester abroad count toward Honors requirements. Upon returning from abroad, students are asked to write a petition in which they are required to reflect on the nature of the course taken abroad and explain why the course meets the desired criteria for general Honors credit, Honors breadth credit and/or Automatic Honors credit. For more details about the petition process, please consult the <a href="http://honors.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Honors Program website</a>.</li> <li>Studying abroad in an Honors Study Abroad Program. (Currently programs are available in Ecuador and Utrecht, Netherlands.) Students may earn up to 16 Honors credits. Students receive Honors credit in these cases through the study abroad equivalency process upon their return from abroad.</li> </ul> <p>In all cases, to receive Honors credit in a course, students must earn a final grade of B or higher in that course. If a grade of BC or lower is earned in an Honors course, the Honors notation remains on the student's record, but the course does not count toward Honors degree requirements. If the course is retaken for Honors, regardless of the grade earned during this second attempt, the course cannot satisfy an Honors degree requirement.</p> <p>Students may not receive Honors credit in courses carried on a pass/fail basis.</p> <h2 headerid="4" name="honorstext">Advising and Careers</h2> <p>The University of Wisconsin–Madison can seem overwhelming because of its size and the complexity of its policies and procedures. Academic advisors help students get (and maintain) their bearings on campus. The L&amp;S Honors Program has a team of specially trained academic and peer advisors who accompany and support Honors candidates as they pursue diverse educational and co-curricular experiences compatible with their long-term goals. Advising occurs through a variety of formats including small group workshops, individual appointments, drop-in hours and email. Additional information is available on the <a href="http://honors.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Honors Program website</a>.</p> <p>The L&amp;S Honors Program encourages our students to begin working on their career exploration and preparation soon after arriving on campus. We partner with the L&amp;S SuccessWorks office to help students leverage the academic skills learned in your major(s) and liberal arts degree, explore and try out different career paths, participate in internships, prepare for the job search and/or graduate school applications, and network with professionals in the field (alumni and employers).</p> <p>Letters &amp; Science graduates are in high demand by employers and graduate programs. It is important to us that our students are career ready at the time of graduation, regardless of major or career goals.</p> <h2 headerid="5" name="honorstext">People</h2> <p>Please see the <a href="https://honors.ls.wisc.edu/meet-the-honors-team-members/" target="_blank">L&amp;S Honors website</a> to find Honors Team Members, including the Director, Associate Directors, Program Administrators, and Academic Advisors.</p> <h2 headerid="6" name="honorstext">Policies</h2> <h3>Criteria for Remaining in Good Standing in HLA</h3> <p>Students must obtain a grade point average of 3.300 or higher to be eligible to graduate with an Honors in the Liberal Arts degree. As such, we encourage students to strive for at least this GPA each academic term. The Honors Program advising team will work with students on an improvement plan should their GPA drop below 3.300. Students must also make satisfactory progress toward degree requirements, meaning:</p> <ol> <li>successfully complete (grade of B or higher) at least one Honors course (any designation) by the end of the third semester on campus and</li> <li>successfully complete (grade of B or higher) at least two Automatic Honors courses by the end of the fifth semester on campus.</li> </ol> <p>Students may withdraw from HLA at any time by completing an Honors in the Liberal Arts Withdrawal Form, available from the Honors Program office, and submitting it to the Honors Program.</p> <h3>Criteria for Remaining in Good Standing in HM</h3> <p>Because each department sets its own criteria for the HM degree program, students are encouraged to work closely with departmental advisors to stay on track towards successful completion. In addition to the criteria established by individual departments, all students must obtain a cumulative grade point average of 3.300 or higher in UW–Madison coursework to be eligible to graduate with the Honors in the Major degree. Students may withdraw from HM at any time by submitting a completed Honors in the Major Withdrawal Form, available from either the department advisor or the Honors Program office.</p> <h3>Honors in the Individual Major</h3> <p>To complete the Individual Major with Honors, the student must earn Honors credit in at least 20 of the 36 or more credits comprising the Individual Major and must complete a Senior Honors Thesis of 6–8 credits.  Students wishing to complete an Honors in the Major degree with an Individual Major should append to their Individual Major proposal a specific outline of how the Honors in the Major requirements would be met, including appropriate Honors-caliber courses, upper-level seminars, and a two-semester capstone project, typically a Senior Honors Thesis. The proposal for Honors in the Individual Major will be reviewed by the Honors Program Associate Director for Academic Services. This individual is authorized to determine whether requests for exceptions to the approved HM requirements will be approved.</p> <h3>Honors Transfer Credit</h3> <p>Honors credit earned at other institutions is not currently accepted towards L&amp;S Honors Program degree requirements.</p> <h2 headerid="7" name="honorstext">Grants and Awards</h2> <p>The L&amp;S Honors Program strives to support Honors students as they pursue original research, study abroad, attend academic conferences, and pursue other endeavors that complement their learning and growth. The following funding opportunities are regularly offered. Please see the <a href="http://honors.ls.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">L&amp;S Honors Program website</a> for additional opportunities, specific deadlines and additional information about the applications process.</p> <h3>Welton Sophomore Summer Honors Research Apprenticeships</h3> <p>These competitively awarded grants provide funding for Honors students who learn more about the research process by working as research apprentices with UW–Madison faculty. Students may not earn course credit for this work. For past students, these apprenticeships often evolved into paid research positions and/or Senior Honors Thesis projects. Applications for the Welton are submitted and considered early in the spring term.</p> <h3>Trewartha Undergraduate Thesis Research Award</h3> <p>This grant enables Honors students to undertake more demanding and extensive Honors Senior Thesis research projects than might otherwise be possible. Besides recognition of an excellent thesis proposal, grant recipients receive funds (up to $1500) to cover travel expenses and other costs needed to complete the research. These resources may enable students to travel to archives or research sites, or to initiate other research activities that require special funding. Each year 12–16 Trewartha awards are granted. Applications for the Trewartha are submitted and considered during the fall term.</p> <h3>Mark Mensink Honors Research Grant</h3> <div>The Mark Mensink Honors Research Grant is the L&amp;S Honors Program's most prestigious grant, awarded in recognition of an exceptional thesis proposal. The purpose of the grant is to enable its recipient to undertake more demanding and extensive Honors senior thesis research than might otherwise be possible due to limited resources or time. Students do not apply specifically for the Mensink award. The Mensink is awarded to a particularly promising Trewartha applicant.</div> <h3>Honors Summer Senior Thesis Research Grant</h3> <p>These grants enable students to undertake more demanding and extensive senior thesis research projects than might otherwise be possible. Besides recognition of an excellent thesis proposal, grant recipients are awarded a cash stipend of up to $3000 to cover research-related expenses. Such resources may enable students to travel to archives or research sites, arrange participant interviews or initiate other research activities that require special funding. Applications for summer research grants are submitted and considered during the spring term.</p> <h3>Leadership Trust Award</h3> <div>The Leadership Trust Award supports students as they plan, develop and implement projects designed to improve UW–Madison, the community and/or the university student body. Each year, up to two (2) students receive awards equal to two (2) semesters of resident, full-time tuition plus project funds up to $3000 as justified in the submitted project budget. Past award recipients have established mentoring programs for underrepresented students; collaborated with local organizations to improve community access to fresh, healthy and local produce; and founded an academic journal, the Madison Journal of Literary Criticism, to increase students' opportunities to see their work published. Applicants are asked to identify a UW–Madison faculty member who will serve in an advisory/resource capacity and award winners are expected to submit progress reports to the L&amp;S Faculty Honors Committee. Applications for the Leadership Trust Award are submitted and considered during the spring term for the following academic year.</div> <h3>Study Abroad Awards</h3> <p>Up to four $1,500 travel awards will be awarded to eligible L&amp;S Honors Program students who plan to study abroad. Students studying for either a semester or a year abroad are eligible, however preference will be given to students participating in a year-long program. Applications for this funding opportunity are available in the spring term.</p> <h3>Bromley Research Conference Travel Grant</h3> <p>These awards are meant to support students who present at and/or attend regional or national professional conferences. Priority is given to those who plan to present. The award amount is up to $500. The application process is competitive and students with the most promising proposals are selected.</p>
