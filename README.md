# datathon_2021
Project for Datathon 2021
## Workload:
1. scrape the internet for datasets
   i) Major Guide (start with Data Science)
   ii) Prerequisites 
   iii) Grade Distribution
   iv) Rate My Professor
3. integrate the datasets in a metric for judgement
4. display of the output data
 
## Importance:
1. Higher education is important, but it could be very overwhelming trying to get to know a major
2. Many people are considering double majoring as the world and subjects gets more integrated (healthcare and data science) <-- Also useful for students who are considering changing major to see overlapse
3. For incoming students exploring majors, this establishes areas of theory studies and possible real-life applications.
4. If there is a more integrated system where people can access the feasibility of completing a major, it would make the selection of major and higher education in general much less overwhelming.
5. So we want to create a platform where people could assess their availability by the classes needed, the overlapse of those classes, the prerequisites to take those credits (so it is a realisitic representation of what is needed), the grade distribution for these classes, and the rate my professor rate for the usual professors of those classes
6. This is really helpful for Undergrads who are considering double majoring, students who are considering major changes after assessing the amount of overlap between their majors and other majors
