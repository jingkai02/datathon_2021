# Major Explorer Project

## Project Description 
The Major Explorer project aims to support college students from University of Wisconsin-Madison with major choices. Having major requirement data scraped from Guide (https://guide.wisc.edu/), where information about all academic programs can be found, the Major Explore project compares overlaping classes between majors and generates most recommended classes to aid students in exploring classes, considering double majoring and chaning majors. This project starts from analyzing the Data Science major and some relevant majors, such as the Mathematics in Data and Risk Analysis and Actuararial Science. A mix of data science matrials are applied, such as data visualization and Monte Carlo Simulation. Based on this project, more combinations between majors may benefit more students in the future.

## What We Did:
1. Scraped datasets <br/>
      i) Started with requirement for Data Science Major from Guide. <br/>
      ii) Based on relative areas from the Guide, Mathematics in Data and Risk Analysis and Actuararial Science majors are included. <br/>
3. Integrated the datasets in a metric for judgement.
4. Used Monte Carlo Simulation to find overlapping courses and remaining courses to take.
5. Displayed the output data.
 
## Why We Care:
1. As the world and subjects gets more integrated, over 1 in 5 students have double majors in their first bachelor's degree. At the same time, around 1 in 3 students enter college as "undecided", and this rate is even higher for underrepresented students, such as first-generation students. Also, around 75% of students change their majors in college.
2. Higher education is important, but with a variety of options provided, it could be overwhelming for college students to distinguish between majors and classes.
3. If there is a more integrated system where people can access the feasibility of completing a major, it would make the selection of major and higher education in general much less overwhelming.
4. For incoming students exploring majors, this project establishes areas of theory studies and possible real-life applications.
5. Overlapping coursesis are visually shown to explore possibilities of double majoring .
6. This project assesses chaging majors in a realistic way, with credits for graduation taken into consideration.
7. Therefore, we created this project to solve real-world issue for undergraduate students who are considering double majoring, students who are considering major changes after assessing the amount of overlap between their majors and other majors. We wanted to create a platform where people could assess their availability by the classes needed, the overlapse of those classes, the prerequisites to take those credits (so it is a realisitic representation of what is needed). In the future, more can be added to this project, such as the grade distribution for these classes, and the rate my professor rate for the usual professors of those classes, to benefit students.
